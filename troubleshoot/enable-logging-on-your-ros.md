# Enable Logging on your ROS

While debugging your application, you can always increase the verbosity of logging to help troubleshoot unexpected behavior.  You can do this easily with a single line of code within your `index` file: 

```javascript
Realm.Sync.setLogLevel('debug');
```

Levels include: 

* `fatal`
* `error`
* `warn`
* `info`
* `detail`
* `debug`
* `trace`
