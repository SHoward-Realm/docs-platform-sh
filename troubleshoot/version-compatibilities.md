# Version Compatibilities

Realm Object Server is backwards compatible with older SDK's, but newer SDK's can not be used with older servers. So always update the server first and then the client SDKs. Below versions require Realm Object Server 2.x:

| Studio | Realm JS | Realm Swift +Objective-C | Realm Java | Realm .Net | Realm Data Adapter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.0 | 2.0 - 2.2  | 3.0 - 3.1 | 4.0-4.3 | &gt;= 2.0 | &gt;= 1.0.0 |
