# React-Native Quick Start

To get started with Realm Platform, we created 3 tutorials to guide you to learning the key functionality. Each tutorial is self-contained, but builds off the previous tutorial, to incorporate more advanced functionality.

In step 1 we will implement the process of query-based synchronization.

Step 2 is currently a work in progress. When completed, you will add class and object-level permissions to the ToDo list application in order to learn about Realm Platform 3.0's access control functionality.
