# Android Quick Start

To get started with Realm Platform, we created 3 tutorials to guide you to learning the key functionality. Each tutorial is self-contained, but builds off the previous tutorial, to incorporate more advanced functionality.

In step 1, you will create your first Realm app, a simple ToDo list that automatically synchronizes across devices:

{% page-ref page="step-1-my-first-realm-app.md" %}

Next, in step 2, you will adapt the ToDo list app to use the new query-based sync provided in Realm Platform 3.0:

{% page-ref page="step-2-adding-partial-sync.md" %}

Finally, in step 3, you will add class and object-level permissions to the ToDo list app to learn about Realm Platform 3.0's access control functionality:

{% page-ref page="step-3-adding-permissions.md" %}
