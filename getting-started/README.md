# Getting Started

## Where do I start? {#the-realm-platform}

We recommend starting by reading over [key concepts](key-concepts.md).  Once you understand the components of the platform, you can [install the Realm Object Server](install-realm-object-server/) and then [sync your first data](syncing-my-first-data.md) from an example backend application.  Finally, you can build your [first application](create-my-first-app.md) that leverages the Realm Platform.  

## What comes next? 

After you've run through our Getting Started guide, we recommend taking a look at our [development docs](../develop/) or diving into one of our [specific learning guides](../learn/).
