# Create My First App ðŸ“±

Now that you have Realm Object Server running, it is time to create your first app that connects to it! We have created tutorials to walk you through building a ToDo list application. Pick your platform to continue.

_Note: these tutorials were built around Realm Cloud, but also work fine with Realm Object Server. Just be sure to adjust the URL to match your server's IP and port._
