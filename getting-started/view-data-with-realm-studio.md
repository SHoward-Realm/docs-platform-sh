## Using Realm Studio {#using-realm-studio}

When you first start the app, you are presented with a welcome screen:

Choose “Connect to Realm Object Server” so we can connect to the ROS running locally.

You are presented with a login screen, which includes defaults. You don’t have to type anything on this screen since the server is running locally at `localhost:9080` and ROS automatically creates an admin user with username: `realm-admin` and password: `“”` \(empty string\). Just press “Connect” to continue!

The next screen shows the current layout of the ROS dashboard functionality. You can view the Realms in the server, the list of Users, and Logs. The two main parts are the ability to view Realm data via a browser, which is possible by clicking on a Realm, and creating/editing users via the Users tab:
