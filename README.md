# Getting Started

## What is Realm Platform? {#what-is-realm-platform}

The Realm Platform is made up of two major components. The Realm Database and the Realm Object Server. These two components work in conjunction to automatically synchronize data enabling a great deal of use cases ranging from offline apps to complex backend integrations.
