# Getting Started

## What is Realm Platform? {#what-is-realm-platform}

The Realm Platform is made up of two major components. The Realm Database and the Realm Object Server. These two components work in conjunction to automatically synchronize data enabling a great deal of use cases ranging from offline apps to complex backend integrations.

Want to take a deeper look? Read the [Realm Overview White Paper](https://www2.realm.io/whitepaper/realm-overview-registration), a comprehensive overview that covers core concepts, key use cases, and implementation examples.

## Where do I start? {#where-do-i-start}

The best way to get started is to try Realm Platform out for yourself!  The platform is offered as both a hosted cloud or a self-hosted plan.  Take a look below to learn how to try either option depending on your own requirements.  

### [Sign-up for a free cloud account](https://cloud.realm.io/) {#sign-up-for-a-free-cloud-account}

Head over to our cloud page and sign up for a free cloud account which provides a 30-day trial experience.  

### [Sign-Up for Self-Hosted Standard Plan trial](https://realm.io/trial/self-hosted-standard-plan) {#sign-up-for-self-hosted-standard-plan-trial}

For various reason, you may need to host your own server.  To learn about how to install, configure, and operate the self-hosted version see this [section]() in the documentation.  You'll likely want to start by [installing the server](self-hosted/installation/).  

### Pick your Platform

We have created several tutorials to teach both the fundamentals and more advanced aspects to the platform. Choose your platform to get started:
