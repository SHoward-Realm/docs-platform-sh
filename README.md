# Getting Started with Realm Platform

## Where do I start?

We recommend starting by reading over [key concepts](getting-started/key-concepts.md). Once you understand the components of the platform, you can [install the Realm Object Serve](getting-started/install-realm-object-server/)r and then [sync your first data](getting-started/syncing-my-first-data.md) from an example backend application. Finally, you can build your [first application](getting-started/create-my-first-app.md) that leverages the Realm Platform.

## What comes next? {#what-comes-next}

After you've run through our Getting Started guide, we recommend taking a look at our [development docs](develop/) or diving into one of our [specific learning guides](https://github.com/realm/docs-platform/tree/4b9669d6d16bc9906cfb086ee09c5ddf47b1fba3/learn/guides/README.md).
