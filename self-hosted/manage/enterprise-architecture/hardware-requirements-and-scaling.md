# Hardware Requirements and Scaling

## Enterprise Production Deployment

The Realm process itself is single-threaded therefore only a single core is ever needed for ROS specific services. The size of the nodes varies by use-case but the  ROS Core Services and ROS sync-workers are designed to serve 10,000 concurrent connections from a single CPU server with 16GBs of RAM. The Realm files are files on disk and the sizing will be completely dependent on your dataset - a good starting point is to have 40GB of free disk space on the volume for Realm to have access to.  


Guidance of the sizing of Consul servers can be found [here](https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/performance.html).  Typically these are much smaller servers with only a single CPU a couple GBs of RAM needed.  


The Consul and Realm components can be deployed on the same server - if this is the case you will want to make sure that each process has its own CPU.

More details around the structure of the deployment can be found [here](./).  

## Development and Test Deployments

For development and test environments the hardware requirements can be drastically scaled down to only a few GBs of RAM needed with a single core. Dev environments are commonly installed on a local laptop either manually or with Docker as seen [here](https://docs.realm.io/platform/getting-started/install-realm-object-server/manual-install%20)

## Dependencies 

The Realm Components must be installed on a Linux server such as Ubuntu 16.04, there are a few dependencies that should be installed first such as Python, node.js, and npm - the exact details can be found [here](https://docs.realm.io/platform/self-hosted/installation).  

## Scaling out ROS components 

In the event of a ROS Core services node is overloaded as shown by a network monitoring tool multiple ROS Core services can be added to the pool by deploying more nodes using a CM tool and then added to the public load balancer configuration as healthy nodes in the LB pool.  


In the event of a ROS sync-worker group is overloaded as shown by a network monitoring tool another group can be added to the pool by deploying more nodes using a CM tool and by choosing a unique name for the `SYNC_LABEL` \(the same for every node in the group but different from other groups\) and a unique `SYNC_ID` for each sync-worker node. The group will automatically be discovered via consul and then new connections will start to take advantage of the increased capacity as distributed by the ROS proxy module.
