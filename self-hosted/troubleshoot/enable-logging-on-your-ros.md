# Enable Logging on your ROS

While debugging your application, you can always increase the verbosity of logging to help troubleshoot unexpected behavior.  You can do this easily within your `index` file by un-commenting some of the pre-generated code like: 

```javascript
// The desired logging threshold. Can be one of: all, trace, debug, detail, info, warn, error, fatal, off) 
// logLevel?: string = 'info' 
logLevel: 'debug',
```

Levels include: 

* `fatal`
* `error`
* `warn`
* `info`
* `detail`
* `debug`
* `trace`
