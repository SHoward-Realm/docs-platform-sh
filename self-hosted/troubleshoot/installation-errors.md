# Installation Errors

While our [install script](../installation/) typically provides a smooth install experience, we have seen a few issues that can arrive depending on your operating environment.  If you continue to run into issues after going through this guide, please contact us via our [forums](https://forums.realm.io/c/rmp-feedback).  

## ros: Command not found.

 `ros: Command not found.` Indicates that your terminal is not able to locate our [CLI](../manage/command-line-interface-for-ros.md).  We find that this is most often caused by using an incompatible version of `nvm`

Before running a `ros` command try running: `nvm use 8` in your terminal.
