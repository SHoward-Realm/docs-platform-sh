# Services

ROS 2.x is also a fully featured web framework! Adding functionality is simple, modular, and service oriented. A ROS custom service is just a class that you can add to a Server instance.

* You can expose methods as http endpoints using @Get, @Post, @Put, @Delete etc...
* You can read parameters using the @Param\('productId'\) or just @Param decorator
* Services don't need http endpoints at all
