# Installation

## Supported Operating Systems {#supported-operating-systems}

We currently support the following operating systems:

* macOS 10+
* Ubuntu 16.04+
* RHEL 6+
* CentOS 7+

We plan to add native support for Windows. In the meantime, you may run the server for development purposes only via [Docker](https://docs.realm.io/platform/~/revisions/-L7Ry-Hl-dUJQWPWE8Nx/getting-started/install-realm-object-server/installing-via-docker).

## Install the Server

The simplest method of installation is by using our install script, which will resolve all prerequisites for you:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realm/realm-object-server/master/install.sh | bash
```
