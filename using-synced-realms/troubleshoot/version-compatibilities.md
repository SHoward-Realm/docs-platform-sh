# Version Compatibilities

Realm Object Server 3.x is backwards compatible with older SDK's. So always update the server first and then the client SDKs. Below minimum versions require Realm Object Server 3.x and supports the new 3.x features like [Query-based Synchronization](../syncing-data.md#using-partial-synchronization) and [Fine-grained Permissions](../access-control/#fine-grained-permissions-1).
