# View Your Data

## Realm Database

Realm Studio allows you to open up a local Realm file and view the data. Once opened, you can edit the data and it will save changes into the Realm.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are working with Realm files on a device, you will need to transfer them onto your machine.
{% endhint %}

### Import Data

Realm Studio supports the ability to create a Realm file from CSV. To do so, go to `File` then `Create Realm from` --&gt; `CSV`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that when importing from CSV, the first row will be used as the object properties.
{% endhint %}

## Realm Platform

Realm Studio allows you to connect to a Realm Object Server, including Self-Hosted or Cloud instances. Once connected you can browser all of the synchronized Realms on the server and open them to view the data. Any changes you make to the data while viewing, will be automatically synchronized to any other devices sharing the data.

### Realms

Once you have logged into your server, you will be able to see a list of the available Realms:

{% hint style="info" %}
You can create a new synchronized Realm. This is useful when you are creating a shared Realm that will be access by many users.
{% endhint %}

### Edit Schema

With synchronized Realms, you can make changes to the schema. This is limited to additive changes only: creating new models and properties.
